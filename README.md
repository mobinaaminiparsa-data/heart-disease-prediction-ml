- Compare multiple classification algorithms
- Evaluate predictive performance
- Identify the most influential risk factors

## Methods
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix)

## Results
- Comparison of model performance
- Identification of significant predictors
- Improved prediction accuracy using ensemble methods

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Conclusion
